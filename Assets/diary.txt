__/11/23 - Session
I cameame in, watched the videos, couldn't find any new useful information. toye around in Unity but i'm already familiar with all the content so I tried to work on other projects only for it to not work, Both CLion and Pycharm were throwing a fit so I gave up and went home early.

24/11/23 - Session
Actually started some work. I created the Unity project and started working, creating a new Quad for the floor. I decided to go for a swimming-pool kind of environment and so I download some content from Textures.com (formerly CGTextures.com). I also created this diary and references txt file to make things easier for the future and will take at least one screenshot per session.

Screenshots will be saved in format "ddmmyy-(screenshot number)"... For an example date of December 4th I will have: 041223-1.

Diary entries will be written as "dd/mm/yy - (location)" with location either being "Home" or "Session" which are self-explanatory.

To save time, any assets downloaded will simply have their date
