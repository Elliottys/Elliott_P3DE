Here I started to brainstorm ideas for what I wanted my interactive environment to be. I decided to use the old project folder for convenience.

My first ideas for the game are:
 • Porch Pirate
 • Underwater Pirates

We're required to create these models:
 • Pirate theme
 • A drinking vessel
 • A box that can open/close
 • A fruit

I also think it would be cool to have a Pirate HQ because that would be really funny.

So in the end, I decided to go with the Porch Pirates idea since that was creative and people seemed to like it.

I took some textures from the internet to use. I made a road using quads of Asphalt, and imported the player controller into a new scene. I also started modeling the fruit, which I chose to be a pear. The pear turned out great. I almost lost the pear actually, but I saved it by using my quick wit and intelligent thinking. I also downloaded a free pear seamless texture, the seemingly only one that exists on the internet. And also, took a random wood texture and compressed it so small that I could pass it off as my own work. Because I'm so cool, I didn't though and still cited it.

Imported a house model and a bundle of particle effects to give smoke to the chimney of the house model. I was given an idea to use WindZones to make the smoke more realistic, in that it has random wind momentum applied.
I tried creating my own smoke effect but struggled to get the flipbook system  to work so I used the template smoke particle given by the bundle of particle effects and modified it to fit my needs.
Then I created a new sidewalk and looked for textures to use for that, so I imported PavingStone-01 for the sidewalk.
Cloned the houses to be side by side, looked really cool but then I realised I should prefab it so I created a new folder for prefabs.

I started creating a basic environment cloning out the road 
I saw some errors so I just... commented out the scripts with the errors, BIG BRAIN!
Added some fog to mask the "endless" road.
Created a new prefab called "Teleporters" including TeleporterA and TeleporterB which have options to link between. My first piece of code.

Changing the step height of the player so that they can climb up stairs.
