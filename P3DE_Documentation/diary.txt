The diary will track what I do whenever I work on this project.

Some writing will go here.
I will be describing what I've done!

Here I started to brainstorm ideas for what I wanted my interactive environment to be. I decided to use the old project folder for convenience.

My first ideas for the game are:
 • Porch Pirate
 • Underwater Pirates

We're required to create these models:
 • Pirate theme
 • A drinking vessel
 • A box that can open/close
 • A fruit

I also think it would be cool to have a Pirate HQ because that would be really funny.

So in the end, I decided to go with the Porch Pirates idea since that was creative and people seemed to like it.

I took some textures from the internet to use. I made a road using quads of Asphalt, and imported the player controller into a new scene. I also started modeling the fruit, which I chose to be a pear. The pear turned out great. I almost lost the pear actually, but I saved it by using my quick wit and intelligent thinking. I also downloaded a free pear seamless texture, the seemingly only one that exists on the internet. And also, took a random wood texture and compressed it so small that I could pass it off as my own work. Because I'm so cool, I didn't though and still cited it.

Imported a house model and a bundle of particle effects to give smoke to the chimney of the house model. I was given an idea to use WindZones to make the smoke more realistic, in that it has random wind momentum applied.
I tried creating my own smoke effect but struggled to get the flipbook system  to work so I used the template smoke particle given by the bundle of particle effects and modified it to fit my needs.
Then I created a new sidewalk and looked for textures to use for that, so I imported PavingStone-01 for the sidewalk.
Cloned the houses to be side by side, looked really cool but then I realised I should prefab it so I created a new folder for prefabs.

I started creating a basic environment cloning out the road 
I saw some errors so I just... commented out the scripts with the errors because I'm so smart.
Added some fog to mask the "endless" road.
Created a new prefab called "Teleporters" including TeleporterA and TeleporterB which have options to link between. My first piece of code.

Changing the step height of the player so that they can climb up stairs.

I decided to limit the scene a bit and start work on the package prop. I was originally going to go for a cartoon 3D package inspired by the game Toontown Rewritten's package 3D model but I decided against this one due to the fact it would be difficult to animate it.
I am struggling to decide what to choose, maybe an amazon package due to the simplicity? But a more complex idea would be better.


Eventually I ended up modeling a coffee cup as my drinking vessel, with plans to make it interactable so you can drink the liquid. Side note: I should make some more interesting fruit to get higher marks.

My models import with a small scale and I need to figure out how to fix that. I did finish my coffee cup model and added a steam effect to the prop.

Finally, it was time to add a skybox to my scene and I found a nice (probably overused by our class) set of skyboxes free on the Unity Asset Store. I used FS013_Sunrise here.

I started work on my Coffee Cup drinking vessel to make it easier to animate in Unity, using the ctrl+t method to make sure the size of the coffee cup is accurate. I also applied some new textures.

I found out that I was missing a plugin in order to use enhanced textures for my model - and I was also advised to use ProBuilder (finally!) for my 3D worlds, which i'm happy to oblige, even if it means restarting my world.

I started creating a new tunnel which will be the spawning point, it will go off into darkness where eventually you'll be met with an invisible wall mid-darkness (so you can't see yourself hit it unless your moonwalking)
The road will lead to the playable area, a small street of buildings and maybe a park area.
And that road will turn the corner into what I call "Troll Road" which is an infinite road where after you give up and turn around, you realise you haven't moved that far.

The tunnel was made a bit longer as I struggled to make a cardboard box and dark tunnel. I decided to move on directly to my other (due very soon and very incomplete) GiC++ project.

Gave up modelling box and decided to expand my scene a bit, I downloaded a bunch of textures from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/world-materials-free-150182 and didn't use it then i
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/floor-materials-pack-v-1-140435
then I used https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/textures-free-122421
started animating the coffee cup
finished animating the coffee cup
expanded map to have the valley, and it kinda looks like a half-life map now which is funny.
