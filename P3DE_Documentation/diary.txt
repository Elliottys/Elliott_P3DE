Here I started to brainstorm ideas for what I wanted my interactive environment to be. I decided to use the old project folder for convenience.

My first ideas for the game are:
 • Porch Pirate
 • Underwater Pirates

We're required to create these models:
 • Pirate theme
 • A drinking vessel
 • A box that can open/close
 • A fruit

I also think it would be cool to have a Pirate HQ because that would be really funny.

So in the end, I decided to go with the Porch Pirates idea since that was creative and people seemed to like it.

I took some textures from the internet to use. I made a road using quads of Asphalt, and imported the player controller into a new scene. I also started modeling the fruit, which I chose to be a pear. The pear turned out great. I almost lost the pear actually, but I saved it by using my quick wit and intelligent thinking. I also downloaded a free pear seamless texture, the seemingly only one that exists on the internet. And also, took a random wood texture and compressed it so small that I could pass it off as my own work. Because I'm so cool, I didn't though and still cited it.
